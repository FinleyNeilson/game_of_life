### Game of Life Simulator
## Overview

This project is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life implemented using Pygame. The Game of Life is a zero-player game where its progression is determined by its initial state. This project allows users to interact with the simulation by toggling cell states and controlling the simulation with keyboard and mouse events.
Features

- Interactive Grid: Users can click on cells to toggle their states between alive and dead.
- Real-Time Simulation: Press the spacebar to start or pause the simulation.
- Dynamic Rendering: Cells are drawn in real-time, reflecting their current state.
- Efficient Performance: Optimized rendering and simulation for smooth gameplay.

## Controls

- Left Click: Toggle the state of a cell (alive/dead).
- Spacebar: Start or pause the simulation.
- Close Window: Exit the application.
